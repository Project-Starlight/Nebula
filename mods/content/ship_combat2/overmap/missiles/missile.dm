/*
	welcome to space war kiddo
	These are overmap capable missiles. Upon being activated, they appear on the overmap and travel along it until it enters a tile with associated z levels.
	Then it appears on the z level and travels on it. Maybe it hits something, maybe not. When it hits the z level edge, it'll disappear into the overmap again.
	The missiles are intended to be very modular, and thus do very little on their own except for handling the missile-overmap object interaction and calling appropriate procs on the missile equipment contained inside.
	Also note that while they're called missiles, it's a bit of a misleading name since the missile behavior is almost wholly determined by what equipment it has.
	Check equipment/missile_equipment.dm for more info.
